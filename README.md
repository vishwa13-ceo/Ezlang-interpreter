# EzLang Interpreter

## Overview

EzLang is a simple interpreted language designed for basic programming tasks. This version of the interpreter supports a minimal set of features aimed at helping you learn the fundamentals of coding. The supported functionalities include:

- **Print Statements:** Use the `print` keyword to output text or values.
- **Variable Assignments:** Assign values to variables using the `=` operator.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Conditional Execution:** Execute code conditionally using `if` statements with basic conditions.

## Supported Syntax

Below is a detailed guide on the syntax you can use:

### 1. Print Statements

To display a message or a value, use the `print` keyword followed by the expression you want to output.

**Example:**
```ezlang
print "Hello, World!"
print 42
print x + 10
```

### 2. Variable Assignments

Assign values to variables using the `=` operator. Variables do not need explicit type declarations.

**Example:**
```ezlang
x = 10
message = "EzLang is fun!"
```

### 3. Arithmetic Operations

You can perform basic arithmetic using the following operators:
- **Addition:** `+`
- **Subtraction:** `-`
- **Multiplication:** `*`
- **Division:** `/` (integer division is supported)

**Example:**
```ezlang
a = 10
b = 5
sum = a + b      // 15
difference = a - b  // 5
product = a * b    // 50
quotient = a / b   // 2 (if using integer division)
```

### 4. Conditional Execution

The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code when a condition is true. In this version, conditions are simple expressions using comparison operators.

**Example:**
```ezlang
x = 10
if x > 5 {
  print "x is greater than 5"
}
```

**Notes:**
- The condition in the `if` statement is evaluated, and if it returns a truthy value, the code inside the curly braces `{}` is executed.
- There is no `else` branch or nested condition support in this version.

## Benefits

- **Simplicity:** The minimal syntax makes it easy to understand and use.
- **Focused Learning:** Ideal for beginners who want to grasp the fundamentals of programming.
- **Quick Prototyping:** Allows you to test basic logic quickly without the complexity of a full programming language.

## How to Use

1. **Write Your Code:**  
   Create a file (or use the online interpreter interface) to write your EzLang code following the syntax rules above.

2. **Run the Interpreter:**  
   The interpreter will parse your code, execute variable assignments and arithmetic operations, process conditional statements, and print output as specified.

3. **Review the Output:**  
   Any output generated by `print` statements will be displayed in the output area of the interpreter.
